    Uncertain environments exert additional challenges to the safety of autonomous vehicles. An example of such an unpredictable element is object detection error. Mitigation techniques include multi-sensor data integration, motion planning, and risk assessment. Upon accommodating multiple scenarios and environments, challenges arise due to scalability concerns and the additional work incurred by building a module for each distribution. We propose a graph-theoretic framework, modeling uncertainty as a vector of random variables for a subset of vertices. The probabilistic expected harm is reduced to finding a shortest path. Neutral digraph zones are queried by a faster subroutine, to reduce the computational time on uncertain zones. Besides correctness proofs, tested emulations on Carla show a reduction in harm caused.

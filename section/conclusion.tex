\textcolor{teal}{\textbf{summary.}} We designed a mechanism that enables autonomous vehicles to take a decision under uncertainty. It is independent of any prior environmental knowledge and can be used with any module producing probabilistic information alongside penalties. Computational time is reduced by querying shortest-path only on uncertain zones. Our dynamic update mechanism utilizes computed uncertain subgraphs. The statistical dropout sampling technique was utilized for evaluation. In particular, minimizing probabilistic expectation conforms to the empirically tested trials on Carla emulator.

\textcolor{teal}{\textbf{future work.}} In this work, we aimed for finding the optimal solution. It may happen that updates are frequent, up to the point where our mechanism has to re-compute everything from scratch. In such case, designing a time-bounded mechanism at the expense of maintaining optimality may be preferred. We suggest to the reading sampling random paths as quick as possible, then improving given the time the vehicle has. Checking \textit{Iterative Methods} may be a good starting point.
